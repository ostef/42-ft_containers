# ft_containers

The goal of this projet is to reimplement the std::vector, std::map and std::stack containers from C++98,
as well as a few utilities such as std::enable_if, std::is_integral, std::equal...

There is also a full fledged implementation of an AVL Tree in avl.hpp, which is used as a basis for the ft::map implementation.
